Adjust: 车载终端控制结果查询。

车辆控制页面添加一个查询车载终端控制结果查询按钮，与后端进行接口对接，如果接收到的值全为0则显示暂无结果，如果不全为0，则只显示有结果的状态，例如1为进行中，2为成功，3为失败，为0则不显示状态。

Adjust: In-vehicle terminal control result query.

Add a query button to query vehicle terminal control results on the vehicle control page and interface with the backend. If the received values are all 0, no results will be displayed. If not all 0, only the status with results will be displayed. For example, 1 is In progress, 2 means success, 3 means failure, and 0 means no status is displayed.

Fix bug: 车辆开关一直弹车辆未登录。

Trigger time: Web端点击车辆开关，一直弹出设备未登录，查看设备登录状态，显示车辆已经是未登入状态。

Why happen: 
1. 车辆已登录时获取车辆状态或者点击开关状态，定时器开启。
2. 此时车辆掉线，定时器仍然开启，不断下发控制指令，后台查到车辆一直为未登录状态。
3. Web端一直弹出车辆未登录，每三秒刷新一次。

How to fix: 添加使用后端的获取车辆登录状态接口，定时器每3秒刷新一次时均查询一遍车辆是否登录，如果登录状态为1，则表示已登录，继续定时器，如果未登录，关闭定时器并且给出提示：车辆未登录，定时器已关闭。

Fix bug: Vehicle switch bomb vehicle is not logged in.

Trigger time: Click the vehicle switch on the web side, and the device is not logged in message keeps popping up. Check the device login status, and it shows that the vehicle is not logged in.

Why happen:
1. When the vehicle is logged in, obtain the vehicle status or click the switch status to start the timer.
2. At this time, the vehicle was offline, but the timer was still on and control instructions were continuously issued. The background found that the vehicle was not logged in.
3. The web page keeps popping up the message that the vehicle is not logged in, and it is refreshed every three seconds.

How to fix: Add a back-end interface for obtaining vehicle login status. When the timer is refreshed every 3 seconds, it will query whether the vehicle is logged in. If the login status is 1, it means logged in. Continue the timer. If not logged in, close the timer. and a prompt is given: the vehicle is not logged in and the timer has been turned off.

Delete: 车辆监测删除显示项。

车辆监测页面可充电储能装置电压和可充电储能装置温度删除可充电储能系统编码长度以及可充电储能系统编码两个显示项。

Delete: Vehicle monitoring deletes displayed items.

The two display items of the rechargeable energy storage device voltage and the rechargeable energy storage device temperature on the vehicle monitoring page are deleted: the rechargeable energy storage system code length and the rechargeable energy storage system code.

```
Optimization: 车辆开关控制。

1. 车辆开关页面，修改为startTimer定时器每一秒调用一次submit函数。
2. 每次调用submit都先清除之前的定时器，获取车辆状态成功开启定时器，获取失败重置车辆开关状态，并且不可点击。
3. 改变车辆开关时先清除之前的定时器，然后不管成功或者失败均开启定时器。

Optimization: Vehicle switch control.

1. The vehicle switch page is modified so that the startTimer timer calls the submit function once every second.
2. Every time you call submit, the previous timer is cleared first. If the vehicle status is obtained, the timer is turned on. If the vehicle status is not obtained, the vehicle switch status is reset and cannot be clicked.
3. When changing the vehicle switch, clear the previous timer first, and then start the timer regardless of success or failure.
```
